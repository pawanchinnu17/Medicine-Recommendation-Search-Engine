üíä The Intelligent Medicine Recommendation Engine
This project brings to life an intelligent, web-based search engine that acts as a smart pharmacist's assistant. It moves beyond simple keyword matching to provide users with truly personalized and relevant medicine recommendations. The core mission is to create a system that understands a user's needs, whether they're searching for a specific product, describing a symptom like "headache," or simply looking for a reminder of what they usually buy.

The result is a fully functional web application with a clean, interactive interface that showcases a sophisticated, multi-layered recommendation logic, all powered by a robust and flexible database backend.

The Core Idea: A Smart Pharmacist's Assistant
The "brain" of this application is designed to think like an expert pharmacist who knows their customers well. When a user searches, the engine doesn't just look for matching words; it analyzes the request on three intelligent layers to determine the best recommendations.

First, it understands the query. The system contains a built-in dictionary that maps common symptoms like "fever" or "acidity" to their correct medical categories, ensuring it always knows what kind of medicine the user is looking for.

Second, it remembers the user's personal history. The engine looks at the specific user's past purchases. If they've bought a certain medicine before, that product is considered more relevant to them, just as a pharmacist would remember a customer's favorite brand.

Finally, it learns from similar users. In a powerful feature known as collaborative filtering, the engine identifies other users with similar shopping habits. It then recommends products that those similar users have also purchased, helping the current user discover new, relevant medicines they might not have known about.

The Foundation: High-Quality, Realistic Data
A recommendation engine is only as smart as its data. Since real-world medical data is private, this project is built on a high-quality synthetic dataset crafted around logical user personas. Instead of random shopping lists, users are grouped into believable profiles:

(Pain & Cold): Simulating a typical family, these users primarily purchase common painkillers, allergy pills, and cough syrups.

(Digestive): These users have a purchase history focused on antacids and medicines for digestive wellness.

(Chronic): This persona represents patients managing long-term conditions like diabetes or hypertension, with a regular and predictable shopping pattern.

This persona-driven approach ensures the data is clean, logical, and realistic, which is the secret ingredient that makes the engine's recommendations so accurate.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
This project was brought to life using a modern, powerful stack of open-source technologies.

Icon

Technology

Role

üêç

Python

The core language for all application logic, data generation, and database interaction.

üéà

Streamlit

The framework used to build and serve the beautiful, interactive web application front-end.

üçÉ

MongoDB

The NoSQL database chosen for its flexibility in storing complex user profiles and purchase histories.

üêº

Pandas

The library used for efficient data handling and manipulation during the initial data seeding process.

ü§°

Faker

The tool used to generate realistic synthetic user names and dates to enrich our dataset.

üì∏ Application Demonstration
Here are some screenshots showcasing the application's intelligent features in action.

1. Symptom-Based Search

A user searching for the symptom "fever" gets relevant recommendations from the "Analgesic" category, demonstrating the app's internal symptom dictionary.

2. Personalized Recommendations (Empty Search)

When the search bar is empty, the engine defaults to a purely personalized mode, suggesting medicines based on the user's most frequent past purchases.

3. Intelligent, Multi-Layered Logic in Action

Here, a user with a (Digestive) profile searches for "fever." The results show a perfect blend of all three logic layers: direct matches, personal purchase history, and collaborative filtering ("Others with similar taste").

Architectural Choice: Why MongoDB?
MongoDB was chosen over a traditional SQL database like MySQL because its flexible document model is a perfect fit for our data. Think of it as choosing between a flexible filing cabinet and a strict library.

A SQL database is like a library with a rigid card catalog where every entry must fit into a predefined table. Storing a user's purchase_history‚Äîa list that can be short or very long‚Äîwould be complex.

MongoDB, however, is like a filing cabinet. Each user gets their own folder, and inside we can store all their information, including their ever-growing shopping list. This approach is more intuitive, flexible, and efficient for retrieving a user's complete profile in a single, simple operation.

üöÄ End-to-End Setup Guide
Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
You will need Python 3.8+ and MongoDB Community Server installed on your system. During the MongoDB setup, ensure you also install MongoDB Compass, which is the best tool for visualizing your data.

Step 1: Set Up the Environment
After getting the project files, open your terminal in the project folder and install the necessary Python libraries:

pip install streamlit pymongo pandas faker

Step 2: Generate the Dataset
With your terminal in the project folder, run the data generation script. This creates the local medicines.csv and users.json files.

python generate_data.py

Step 3: Seed the Database
Make sure your MongoDB server is running in the background. Then, run the seeder script to populate your database with the newly generated data:

python seed_db.py

Step 4: Run the Application!
You are all set. Start the Streamlit web application with this final command:

streamlit run app.py

Your web browser will automatically open a new tab with the running application. Enjoy exploring your intelligent recommendation engine!
